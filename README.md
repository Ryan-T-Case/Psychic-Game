# The Psychic Game

##Description

* **What is The Psychic Game?**
The Psychic Game is a simple guessing game created using Javascript.

* **How Does The Psychic Game Work?**
The game begins with Wins and Losses at zero, and Guesses Left at nine. The player inputs a key to guess which letter the computer is thinking of. If the guess is correct, the Wins increase by one, the guesses left resets to nine, and the computer generates a new letter to be guessed. If the player guesses incorrectly, their Guesses Left decreases by one until zero is reached. When zero guesses remain, the player loses, and Losses increase by one, the guesses left resets to nine, and the computer generates a new letter to be guessed.

* **Target Audience of The Psychic Game**
The target audience is anyone interested in simple games made with Javascript that demonstrate use of basic concepts such as DOM manipulation and onkeyup events.

* **Purpose of the Project**
The purpose of this project was to practice Javascript concepts learned through Week 3 of the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp.
