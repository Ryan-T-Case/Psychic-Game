//There are wins, losses, guesses left, and guesses so far

//Computer thinks of a random lowercase letter

//Player inputs a letter to guess what computer is thinking

//Game checks if that letter matches the computer's letter

//If the letter matches, add a win to the Wins total

//If the letter does not match, deduct from the guesses left total

//If guesses left reaches 0, add a loss to the losses total

//If a win or loss occurs, reset the game.
